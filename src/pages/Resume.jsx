        I make sure that all vehicles that are cleaned are at the highest standard. All interior components are cleaned. Paint is cleaned, decontaminated and polished/paint corrected. All vehicles are
        prepared for sale. Minor scratch repair is also completed.</p>

        As an automotive technician, I was required to make sure that all vehicle components were up to safety standard laws in Pennsylvania. I was also required to make sure that all vehicle emissions
        equipment was up to standard and functioning properly. I made all repairs and maintenance requested by customers. I completed full vehicle diagnostics to solve issues with check engine lights
        to small squeaks that a vehicle may have been making. I used diagnostic scanners and software to solve these issues. I am able to work on and repair all aspects of a vehicle including; brakes,
        suspension, engine, body and interior components.

      I wanted to become a knowledgeable and reliable full stack developer. I am always trying to learn new techniques and skills as the coding world is ever-changing. I want to continue and build my
      experience as a coder as time goes on. I am open-minded to any types of training and certificates I can achieve to better my coding background. I have learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript through this
      course. I have experience with Node.js, multiple CSS frameworks (ie Bootstrap, Materialize and Tailwind) and jquery. I am experienced using GitBash and GitHub repositories. I am willing to learn any aspects of coding.

        I entered school with the mindset of becoming the most knowledgeable technician that I could be. I wanted to be able to diagnose problems and fix the issue directly instead of guessing and causing
        unnecessary costs to customers. I entered the field as an honest and open-minded technician willing to learn as much as I could.
